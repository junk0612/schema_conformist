# SchemaConformist

**WIP**

SchemaConformist is an automatic JSON response validator for your API in Rails.

This library automatically validates JSON responses are conformant with the schema. The schema can be described as either [OpenAPI 2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) or [JSON Hyper Schema](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-hypermedia.html).

This library uses [Committee](https://github.com/interagent/committee) and [Committee::Rails](https://github.com/willnet/committee-rails) to validate JSONs.
